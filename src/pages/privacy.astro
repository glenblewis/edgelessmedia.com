    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 25, 2026</em></p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Edgeless Media ("we", "us", "our") builds mobile applications. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how we handle it.</p>

    <h3>Data We Collect</h3>
    <p><strong>Anonymous analytics:</strong> We use PostHog to collect anonymous usage analytics (screens viewed, features used). No personally identifiable information is attached to these events. You can opt out in the app settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Crash reports:</strong> We use Sentry to collect crash reports that help us fix bugs. These may include device type, OS version, and stack traces. No personal data is included.</p>
    <p><strong>Account data:</strong> If you create an account (optional), we store your email address and authentication credentials securely via our identity provider. Account creation enables cloud sync and backup.</p>
    <p><strong>User-generated content:</strong> Data you create within our apps (entries, settings, preferences) is stored locally on your device and, if you enable sync, encrypted and stored on our servers.</p>

    <h3>Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell your data to third parties.</li>
      <li>We do not track you across other apps or websites.</li>
      <li>We do not collect location data unless an app's core feature requires it (e.g., lighthouse discovery), and only with your explicit permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <p>Some of our apps display ads via Google AdMob in the free tier. AdMob may collect device identifiers for ad personalization. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings. Paid tiers remove all advertising.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Our apps may use the following third-party services, each with their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob (advertising)</li>
      <li>RevenueCat (subscription management)</li>
      <li>PostHog (anonymous analytics)</li>
      <li>Sentry (crash reporting)</li>
      <li>Google Sign-In and Apple Sign-In (authentication)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Our apps are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
    <p>You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from the app settings. Upon deletion, your data is permanently removed from our servers within 30 days.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app or by updating the date above.</p>
